Develop an intelligent real-time hard labor safety monitoring system, incorporating Artificial Intelligence analytics for early fault detection and diagnosis. In simple terms, acquire daignosos data from a machine for eg car engine and use machine learning to predict when will be the engine highly likely to break.

Step 1: Acquire Data
Step 2: Import important libraries
Step 3: Cleaning/Preprocessing of the dataset
Step 4: Feature Scaling the dataset and creating dummmy variables if necessary
Step 5: Apply ML algorithm like PCA to reduce the dimensions of dataset if necessary
Step 6: Apply ML algorithm to predict the results (might skip step 5 if no reductions are required)
Step 7: Visualise the results
