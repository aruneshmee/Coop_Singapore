Develop an intelligent real-time hard labor safety monitoring system, incorporating Artificial Intelligence analytics for early fault detection and diagnosis. In simple terms, acquire daignosos data from a machine for eg car engine and use machine learning to predict when is the engine highly likely to break down.

- Step 1: Acquire the data
- Step 2: Cleaning/Preprocessing of the dataset
- Step 3: Feature Scaling the dataset and creating dummmy variables if necessary
- Step 4: Apply ML algorithm to predict the results 
- Step 5: Visualise the results

Purpose: To save downtime required to repair or even replace the machine due to an unexpected failure or technical fault. Knowing the health of the machine before hand may help in periodic mantainance and help to save time and money.
